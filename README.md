## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that predicts the profit of a startup based on its features such as the location, R&D Spend, Administration Spend, and Marketing Spend.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiple-linear-regression.git
   cd multiple-linear-regression
   ```

2. Make sure you have the dataset `Successful_Startups.csv` in the project directory.

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Requirements

Make sure to install the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Visualization

The model's predictions are visualized in a scatter plot comparing the actual values against the predicted values, with a reference line indicating perfect predictions.
